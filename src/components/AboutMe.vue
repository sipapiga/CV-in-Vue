          <p class="subheading ml-10" >I was born in Thailand but I have lived in Sweden for 13 years. I have previously worked in a restaurant, but after 10 years in the industry I felt that I wanted a new challenge. I have always been interested in technology and found a suitable education so it felt like it was time to change careers. In addition to school and work, I have also had the opportunity to travel and meet new people.</p>
